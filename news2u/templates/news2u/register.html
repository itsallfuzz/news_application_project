                        <p>As a Publication House, you will manage a news publication
                            and oversee a team of journalists and editors. You'll
                            coordinate content creation, build your subscriber base,
                            and ensure quality standards across all articles and
                            newsletters published under your name. Publishers have
                            full visibility of their team's work and publication
                            analytics. All publisher registrations undergo an
                            administrator approval process to verify the legitimacy of
                            your publication before you can access your dashboard.

                    <p>As an Editor, you play a crucial role in maintaining content
                        quality and editorial standards. You'll review, approve, and
                        edit articles and newsletters submitted by journalists
                        before they're published or sent to subscribers. Editors
                        can also delete inappropriate content and provide feedback
                        to writers. Your approval is required before any content
                        reaches our readers. All editor registrations are subject
                        to administrator approval to ensure you have the appropriate
                        experience and qualifications for this role.
